# PayPal Payment Integration Migration Guide

This guide documents the migration from Stripe to PayPal for the HellaMaid Cleaning Service booking system.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- **Removed**: Stripe dependencies
  - `@stripe/react-stripe-js`
  - `@stripe/stripe-js`
  - `stripe`
- **Added**: PayPal dependencies
  - `@paypal/react-paypal-js` (client-side React components)
  - `@paypal/checkout-server-sdk` (server-side API)

### 2. New PayPal Payment Component
- **File**: `src/components/PayPalPaymentForm.tsx`
- **Interface**: Maintains the same props as `StripePaymentForm` for seamless replacement
- **Features**:
  - PayPal Smart Payment Buttons
  - Support for PayPal, debit/credit cards, and other payment methods
  - Automatic detection of available payment methods based on buyer's location
  - Built-in loading states and error handling
  - Responsive design matching existing UI

### 3. Serverless Functions
- **Create Order**: `netlify/functions/create-paypal-order.js`
- **Capture Payment**: `netlify/functions/capture-paypal-order.js`
- Both functions include:
  - CORS handling
  - Error validation
  - PayPal SDK integration
  - Proper response formatting

### 4. Environment Variables
Added to `.env` file:
```env
# PayPal Configuration
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID_HERE
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID_HERE
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_ACTUAL_PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
PAYPAL_BUSINESS_EMAIL=business@hellamaid.com
```

### 5. Component Updates
- **File**: `src/components/PriceCalculator.tsx`
- **Change**: Import and usage updated from `StripePaymentForm` to `PayPalPaymentForm`
- **Props**: No changes required - identical interface maintained

## PayPal Smart Payment Buttons Features

### Automatic Payment Method Detection
PayPal Smart Payment Buttons automatically show relevant payment options based on:
- Buyer's location and preferences
- Available funding sources
- Device type and capabilities

### Supported Payment Methods
- **PayPal**: Full PayPal checkout experience
- **Debit/Credit Cards**: Direct card processing without PayPal account
- **PayPal Credit**: Buy now, pay later options (where available)
- **Venmo**: For US customers (where enabled)
- **Local Payment Methods**: Country-specific options

## Setup Instructions

### 1. PayPal Developer Account Setup
1. Go to [PayPal Developer Portal](https://developer.paypal.com/)
2. Create or log into your developer account
3. Create a new application
4. Get your Client ID and Client Secret
5. For production: Get live credentials

### 2. Environment Configuration
Update your environment variables:

**Local Development (.env)**:
```env
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sandbox_client_secret
PAYPAL_BUSINESS_EMAIL=your_business_email@example.com
```

**Netlify Production Environment**:
```env
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_live_client_secret
PAYPAL_BUSINESS_EMAIL=your_business_email@example.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Testing
Use PayPal's sandbox environment for testing:
- Sandbox buyer accounts for testing payments
- Sandbox seller account for receiving payments
- Test various payment scenarios and error cases

## Security Considerations

1. **Client ID**: Safe to expose in client-side code
2. **Client Secret**: Server-side only, never in client code
3. **Environment Variables**: Properly configured in Netlify
4. **CORS**: Properly configured for your domain

## Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Monitor payments in PayPal Business Dashboard
- Check Netlify function logs for errors
- Set up alerts for failed payments

### Updates
- Keep `@paypal/react-paypal-js` updated
- Monitor PayPal API changes and deprecations
- Test payment flows after updates
