# üöÄ Post-Deployment Checklist - Netlify Production Setup

## ‚úÖ Immediate Verification Steps

### 1. Basic Site Functionality
- [ ] **Site loads successfully**: Visit your Netlify URL and verify the homepage loads
- [ ] **SSL Certificate active**: Check that HTTPS is enforced (green lock icon)
- [ ] **All pages accessible**: Test navigation between price calculator and quick calculator
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness**: Test on mobile devices

### 2. Payment System Detection
Open browser developer tools and test payment method detection:

#### Desktop Chrome
- [ ] **Expected**: Google Pay + PayPal options visible
- [ ] **Check Console**: No payment-related errors
- [ ] **UI Test**: Payment method selection works

#### Desktop Safari
- [ ] **Expected**: Apple Pay + PayPal options visible (if on macOS with Touch ID)
- [ ] **Check Console**: No Apple Pay validation errors
- [ ] **UI Test**: Payment method buttons render correctly

#### Mobile Testing

### 3. Environment Variables Check
In Netlify dashboard, verify these are set:

#### Current Test Variables (Should be present)
- [ ] `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` (should be sandbox ID currently)
- [ ] `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` (sandbox secret)
- [ ] `NODE_VERSION` = "18"

#### Production Variables (Need to be added)

- [ ] `VITE_GOOGLE_MERCHANT_ID` (when Google Pay is configured)
- [ ] `VITE_GOOGLE_GATEWAY_MERCHANT_ID` (when Google Pay is configured)
- [ ] `GOOGLE_PAY_ENVIRONMENT` = "PRODUCTION"

## üîß Current Status Assessment

### What's Working Now (Development Mode)
‚úÖ **PayPal Sandbox**: Should work with test payments
‚úÖ **Apple Pay Detection**: Shows on compatible devices (but won't process payments)
‚úÖ **Google Pay Detection**: Shows on compatible browsers (but won't process payments)
‚úÖ **Real-time Calculator**: Price calculations and animations
‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

### What Needs Production Setup
üü° **Apple Pay**: Requires merchant certificate and domain verification
üü° **Google Pay**: Requires merchant account and gateway configuration
üü° **PayPal Production**: Requires production client credentials
